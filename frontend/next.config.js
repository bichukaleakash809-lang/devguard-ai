/**
 * Two build modes, because two things need to ship and they need opposite
 * outputs.
 *
 *   * default (`standalone`) — what frontend/Dockerfile expects: a
 *     self-contained server.js with only the node_modules actually reachable at
 *     runtime, which is what keeps the runtime image from needing the full
 *     dependency tree.
 *   * `NEXT_OUTPUT=export` — a fully static site for §10.11's replay URL. The
 *     Command Center fetches its bundles from `public/replay/` in the browser
 *     and no route does data access on the server, so the whole thing renders
 *     from files on any static host, with no DataHub, no key and no database.
 *
 * `images.unoptimized` is required under `export`: the default image optimiser
 * is a server feature, and leaving it on makes the export fail rather than
 * silently degrade.
