"""
Benchmark harness tests.

`benchmark.py` is the only thing in the repo that could ever produce a
publishable accuracy figure, and LAW 6 says every published number comes from
the machine. That makes the harness's own correctness load-bearing: a wrong
denominator or a silently-swallowed failure would publish a wrong number with
full authority.

THE DEFECT THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
--------------------------------
A snippet whose scan raised `AgentExecutionError` was recorded as
`found = set()` — identical to a scan where the Scanner correctly reported
nothing. Those are different facts: the second is a detection miss, the first is
an infrastructure failure. Collapsed together, a run during an API outage
published itself as poor recall, with nothing in the report to indicate the
metrics were computed over a degraded run.
