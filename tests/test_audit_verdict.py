"""
The audit trail must record the verdict it is auditing.

SECURITY.md, "What is implemented today":

    "Tamper-evident audit trail. Every scan appends a hash-chained record
     (backend/core/audit.py); GET /audit-log/verify re-verifies the chain."

All of that is true. The chain is real, the tamper detection works, and 37 tests
in `test_audit_chain.py` demonstrate it. But the record's one substantive field —
what the pipeline actually decided — was never written.

THE DEFECT THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
--------------------------------
`_finalize` wrote the audit entry with:

    verdict=str(getattr(result, "verdict", "unknown"))

`result` is a **PipelineResult**, which has no `verdict` field — the verdict
lives at `final_validation.verdict`. So the `getattr` default won every time and
every entry recorded the literal string `"unknown"`.

Measured against the log committed in this repository:

    entries: 35
      verdict='unknown': 35

35 out of 35. A cryptographically sound, tamper-evident chain of records that
say nothing. The same `getattr(result, "verdict", "unknown")` also fed the
`verdict` field of every `POST /scan` response.

This is the fourth instance in one session of the same root cause: a function
annotated `result: ScanResult` being handed a `PipelineResult`, reading a field
that does not exist, and silently taking the `getattr` default.

NOTE ON THE EXISTING LOG: the 35 committed entries are NOT rewritten. They
honestly record what the system knew when it wrote them, and editing a
hash-chained audit log to look better is precisely the act the chain exists to
detect.
