"""
Which of the four advertised self-observation loops actually fire.

The README presents four loops as a table of working behaviour, and that table is
the project's headline differentiator. Two of the four do fire. Two do not, for
different reasons, and neither the README nor the code said so.

THE OVERCLAIM THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
-----------------------------------
README, "The Differentiator: Self-Observation":

    | Pattern-Learning Agent | Historical Validator fail-rate per CWE |
      Elevates RAG retrieval depth (k) for CWE classes with a track record of
      needing more context |

Two things are wrong with that as a statement about a scan:

1. **It is not wired into the scan pipeline at all.** `ai_agent.py` imports
   `suggest_context_k` with `# noqa: F401 (kept imported; see run_pipeline note
   on why it's not called yet)`. `run_pipeline` calls `run_scanner(code)` with no
   `k_context`, so retrieval depth is always the default 4, and both return paths
   hard-code `context_k_adjusted=False`. The only caller is
   `god_mode_orchestrator.execute_llm_judge` — a Nexus endpoint the README itself
   describes as running synthetically.

2. **It cannot fire anywhere, even where it is called.** `suggest_context_k` asks
   `mcp_client.get_cwe_failure_pattern` for each candidate CWE. That query has no
   local fallback — unlike `get_recent_cost_trend`, which falls back to
   `local_telemetry` — so with no SigNoz MCP server it returns
   `PatternStats(available=False)` every time, `max_failure_rate` stays 0.0, and
   the function returns `base_k`. Measured: `suggest_context_k(["CWE-89"],
   base_k=4)` returns **4**, never the configured `ELEVATED_CONTEXT_K` of 8.

So the loop is blocked on the same unverified MCP integration as the rest of T2,
not merely unwired. These tests pin the true behaviour so the claim and the code
cannot drift apart again, and so that wiring it up later fails a test rather than
passing silently.

WHY THIS IS NOT "FIXED" HERE: making it fire means changing the Scanner's prompt
context on the main detection path. Whether more context improves or degrades
detection is exactly the thing that needs a live LLM key to measure, and there is
none (open issue 2). Shipping an unmeasurable behaviour change to the most
important path would be the wrong call; documenting it accurately is not.
