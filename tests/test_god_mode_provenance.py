"""
`data_source` must describe the whole payload, not its best part.

`god_mode_orchestrator.py`'s own docstring:

    "Every response includes a `data_source` field: `"live"` when it was
     produced from real telemetry/pipeline output..."

SECURITY.md, "What is implemented today":

    "Honest provenance. Every god-mode response carries a `data_source` of
     `live`, `local_shadow`, `synthetic` or `partial`, and the UI renders it. An
     in-process estimate is never presented as retrieved telemetry."

That contract holds only if one `data_source` value is true of everything in the
response. In `execute_precog_agent` it was not.

THE DEFECT THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
--------------------------------
`execute_precog_agent` flips `data_source` to `"live"` when the **error rate**
comes back from MCP. But the memory axis of the same response is unconditionally
invented:

    starting_rss_mb    = round(random.uniform(160.0, 260.0), 1)
    leak_rate_mb_per_min = round(random.uniform(2.0, 14.0), 2)
    minutes_to_oom     = (oom_ceiling_mb - starting_rss_mb) / leak_rate_mb_per_min

So a payload badged `"live"` carried a fabricated current RSS, a fabricated leak
rate, and an OOM countdown derived from both — and `frontend/components/nexus/
PreCogPanel.tsx` renders all three (`starting_rss_mb`, `leak_rate_mb_per_min`,
`projected_minutes_to_oom`).

The error-rate half being real does not make the memory half real. A single flag
that reports the most favourable component is exactly the mislabel pattern
already fixed twice in T1 — the MCP cost fallback reporting "live", and the
executive roll-up deriving provenance from the absence of errors.

Two fixes here:

* The current RSS is **measurable** — this process's own resident set size, from
  the stdlib. There is no reason to invent it.
* The leak *rate* is not measurable from one sample, so it stays a scenario
  parameter and is labelled as one. `data_source` now reports the honest
  aggregate, and a per-axis breakdown says which half came from where.
