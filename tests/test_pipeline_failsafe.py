T2 §6.7 — "Fail-safe stays fail-safe. SigNoz down must never break a scan. Prove
it with a test that runs the pipeline with the collector unreachable."

`tests/test_telemetry_failsafe.py` already covers the ENDPOINTS with a dead
collector. It does not cover the reflection pipeline itself — `run_pipeline` was
never exercised in that state, so the contract's actual wording ("runs the
pipeline") had no test behind it. This file closes that gap.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT UNDER TEST. The three agent calls are monkeypatched, exactly
as in test_pipeline_loop.py, so no API key, network or spend is involved. What is
being proven is that the ORCHESTRATION plus the TELEMETRY LAYER stay correct when
the OTLP exporter cannot reach anything: the loop still converges, the result is
unchanged, and no exporter error escapes into the caller's path. The models'
judgement is not under test here and never has been.

WHY THIS IS A REAL RISK, not a formality. Telemetry is initialised at import and
wrapped around every agent call. A `BatchSpanProcessor` whose exporter refuses
connections retries on a background thread; if any of that leaked synchronously —
an unhandled `ConnectionError`, a blocking flush, a span context manager that
re-raises on `__exit__` — a scan would fail *because observability* failed, which
is precisely the inversion the contract forbids.
