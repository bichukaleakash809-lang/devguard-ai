"""
Tests for §10.11's replay bundle — the thing the Command Center renders.

The bundle is the only input to the UI, so a defect here is invisible in code
review and highly visible to a judge. The four properties worth pinning are the
four that would each produce a *plausible* wrong screen:

  * **Every `raw_ref` resolves.** The evidence chips, the tool-call rows and the
    panel "raw" buttons are all dictionary lookups into `raw`. A second spelling
    of the same path renders a dead button rather than an error, and this test
    is what caught exactly that (panels were emitting `<run-id>/…` while the
    chain used `evidence/proof-pack/<run-id>/…`).
  * **Unknown stays unknown.** §10.10 forbids placeholder numbers. Cost must be
    None on every captured run, because no model was ever invoked, and a `0.0`
    creeping in would read as "this was free".
  * **A refusal is not a success.** The refused run must carry no root cause and
    no time-to-root-cause, and must still name the missing evidence class.
  * **Derived state is justified.** A partial pack must not report a state its
    artifacts do not support.
