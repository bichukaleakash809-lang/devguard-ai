Graceful degradation — does the fallback actually degrade to a different model?

README, Core Features:

    "Circuit breaker + graceful degradation with an AI-generated postmortem
     the moment it trips"

`resilience.py`'s own docstring:

    "SRE NOTE: We annotate the ScanResult / span with which model actually
     served the request ("served_by") and whether we degraded, so a judge (or
     on-call) can immediately see 'this answer came from the fallback' during an
     incident."

THE DEFECT THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
--------------------------------
`_invoke(request, model_id)` took a model and threw it away:

    telemetry.trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("llm.model_id", model_id)
    return await run_pipeline(request.code)          # <- model_id unused

`run_pipeline` did its own severity-based routing with no override hook, so the
"fallback attempt" re-ran the *identical* models the primary attempt had just
used. Two consequences, and the second is worse:

1. It was a plain retry, not a degradation. The escape hatch offered no cheaper
   or differently-provisioned path — so a primary outage caused by the 70B model
   being unavailable would fail again for the same reason.

2. **The span lied about it.** The caller stamped
   `llm.served_by = FALLBACK_MODEL` and `llm.degraded = True` regardless. During
   an incident, a trace would state that `llama-3.1-8b-instant` served the
   request when the 70B model actually did. That attribute is exported to
   SigNoz, so the false claim lands on the exact surface an on-call engineer
   would trust, in the exact situation where being wrong costs the most.

`_invoke`'s docstring was candid about the mechanism ("record model_id only as a
span attribute ... even though the AI layer doesn't act on it directly"). The
caller then published it as fact anyway. LAW 4: live or labelled.
