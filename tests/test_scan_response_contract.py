"""
Contract tests for the JSON `POST /scan` hands the Result Dashboard.

`_build_frontend_result` is the single place where internal pipeline objects
become the numbers a human reads on screen. Everything it emits is presented by
`frontend/app/result/page.tsx` as measured fact: an "Accuracy benchmark proof
strip", a "Tokens Used" metric card, CVSS before/after scores to one decimal,
and a green "✅ Chain Verified" tamper-evidence badge.

THE DEFECTS THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
---------------------------------
Four values in that response were constants, not measurements:

1. `benchmark_report` was `{accuracy: 0.9, precision: 0.92, recall: 0.88,
   false_positive_rate: 0.05, sample_size: 14}` — hand-typed. The harness in
   `backend/core/benchmark.py` has never been run to an artifact, and the README
   says so in as many words ("no accuracy figures are published anywhere"),
   while the result page published them on every scan.

2. `audit_entry.chain_verified` was the literal `True`, and `prev_hash` the empty
   string. Worse, both are computed BEFORE the audit entry is written — the
   append is fired as a background task after this function returns. So the API
   asserted a verified hash chain for a record that did not exist yet. The
   frontend type even documents the field as "sourced from /audit-log/verify",
   which it was not.

3. `tokens_used` was `0` on every response, rendered as a "Tokens Used" metric.

4. `cvss_before` came from a hard-coded severity->score map (critical -> 9.5)
   and `cvss_after` was the constant `1.2`, both displayed with `.toFixed(1)`
   as though a CVSS vector had been scored.

LAW 3 (never fabricate) and LAW 6 (every published number comes from the
machine) both apply. The fix is not better constants — it is `None`, so the UI
can say "not measured" instead of inventing a measurement.
