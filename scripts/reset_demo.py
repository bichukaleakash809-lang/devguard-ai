reset_demo.py — §8's "honest reset, not fake revert".

§8: *"DataHub incidents are resolved, not deleted; edits are overwritten or
soft-deleted. Ship `make reset-demo` (tear down + re-seed the environment) and
document precisely what can and cannot be un-written. Do **not** promise
`revert-writeback`."*

So this resets **the substrate**, which is genuinely resettable, and is explicit
about the catalog, which is not.

WHAT THIS RESETS (completely):
  * `substrate/dbt/models/staging/stg_users.sql` — restored from git, so the
    model once again references `user_id` by name.
  * `raw.users` — the column is put back to `customer_id`, i.e. the BROKEN
    state, because that is the state D3/D4/D5's evidence was collected against
    and the state the hero loop starts from.
  * `analytics_devguard_check*` — any leftover Referee validation schemas.

WHAT THIS CANNOT UN-WRITE, and says so rather than pretending:
  * **Incidents.** DataHub incidents are resolved, never deleted. A reset run
    raises a NEW incident; the old ones stay in the entity's history, which is
    correct — they really happened.
  * **Context Documents.** `save_document` has no delete in the negotiated tool
    set. Re-running overwrites by title where the server supports it and
    otherwise adds another document.
  * **Column descriptions and tags.** Overwritten on the next run, not removed.
  * **Structured properties.** `devguard.verified_at` keeps the most recent
    value. It is only ever written after a verified recovery, so a stale value
    still refers to a real one.
