"""
evidence.py — the §7 Evidence & Provenance contract, typed.

§7 opens with "Typed contracts everywhere. No raw dicts across module
boundaries." That is not decoration here: the whole claim DevGuard makes is that
its conclusions are *traceable to something real*, and the only way that claim
survives contact with a judge is if provenance is a field the type system
enforces rather than a convention people remember.

Three axes, deliberately independent:

  source      WHERE it came from   (a runtime failure? the catalog? our own head?)
  trust       whether an attacker could have written it
  confidence  whether we watched it happen or reasoned our way to it

They are independent because they genuinely vary independently. A dataset
description read from DataHub is `DATAHUB_GRAPH` + `UNTRUSTED_TEXT` + `OBSERVED`:
we really did observe it, and it is really attacker-controllable. A root cause is
`DEVGUARD_INFERENCE` + `TRUSTED_SYSTEM` + `INFERRED`. Collapsing these into one
"confidence" number is exactly the mush §7 is written to prevent.

The rule that matters most is `EvidenceChain.is_sufficient`: a root cause needs
at least one RUNTIME and at least one DATAHUB_GRAPH item. §7: "If the chain
cannot form, the Diagnostician returns INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE and the loop stops.
An agent that knows when to stop scores higher than one that always answers."
