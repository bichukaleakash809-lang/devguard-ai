"""
faults.py — §9B's scripted fault library, and the deterministic classifier.

§9B: *"5–8 scripted faults, each with an expected root-cause label: column
rename · type change · null-rate spike · upstream table dropped · permission
revoked · silent value drift · **control: unrelated noise with no real fault**
(expected answer: `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`). Publish accuracy, false-positive
rate, and per-fault results as a README table."*

All seven are here and all seven are **really injected into the real
PostgreSQL** — no mocks, no recorded fixtures. Each knows how to revert itself,
and the harness reverts in a `finally` so an interrupted run does not leave the
substrate poisoned.

WHAT THE ACCURACY NUMBER MEANS, PRECISELY

§9B is written for a system whose root cause comes from the Diagnostician. That
agent cannot run here (`api.groq.com` denied at CONNECT), so what is being
scored is **DevGuard's deterministic detection-and-classification path**: given
real runtime evidence, does it assign the right label, and does it refuse when it
should? That is a real, falsifiable measurement of a real component — it is just
not a measurement of LLM diagnosis, and the published table says so.

`classify()` is deliberately conservative. It reads only what the runtime
actually reported and returns `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` whenever no failure signal
exists. It has no access to which fault was injected, which is what makes the
score meaningful rather than circular.
