sentinel.py — §6's Sentinel, on the catalog-text side.

§6 gives Sentinel two jobs; this module is the first one: *"Fence and screen
**all** catalog-sourced text for injection."* (Scanning the proposed fix is the
Surgeon-side job and lands with the Surgeon in D6.)

§11.2 is the requirement being met: *"all catalog free-text is UNTRUSTED_TEXT,
fenced in prompts, never instruction. **No tool call may be selected on the
basis of catalog free-text.**"*

Design note worth stating plainly, because overclaiming here would be its own
LAW 3 problem: **detection is a signal, not a defence.** The pattern list below
will miss novel phrasings, and it is not what makes DevGuard safe. What makes
DevGuard safe is architectural — the agent that reads this text
(Diagnostician) holds zero tools, so text that successfully manipulates its
reasoning still cannot cause an action. The screen exists to *surface* attempts
as evidence (§11.7's demo beat), and to refuse to let untrusted text stand alone
as justification. `backend/core/ai_agent.py` already ships the fencing primitive
used here; it is reused rather than reimplemented.
