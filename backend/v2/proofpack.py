proofpack.py — §12's capture layer. Redacted at capture time, size-capped.

§12: "Proof pack — evidence/proof-pack/<run-id>/: raw MCP request/response JSON
with timestamps … **Redacted at capture time**, size-capped with truncation
markers."

"At capture time" is the whole design constraint. A redaction pass that runs
before publishing is a pass you can forget to run; one that runs inside the
writer cannot be forgotten, because there is no other way to get bytes into the
pack. Every agent writes through `ProofPack.write`, and `ProofPack.write` is the
only thing in this package that opens a file for writing under evidence/.
