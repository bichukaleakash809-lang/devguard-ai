ablation.py — §9A's harness, and §9C's cost accounting.

§9A: *"Same incident, same asset. Two arms: `retrieval=on` and `retrieval=off`
(a flag). **N ≥ 5 runs per arm.** Report **median** plus min/max, not a single
number. Primary metric: **time-to-root-cause**. Secondary: MCP tool calls,
tokens, and cost per arm."*

READ THIS BEFORE READING ANY NUMBER THIS MODULE PRODUCES.

The ablation is designed to measure whether *retrieving DevGuard's own prior
runbooks* makes it reach a root cause faster. That effect is mediated entirely
by the Diagnostician: retrieved knowledge enters its prompt, and a better prompt
should shorten the reasoning. **The Diagnostician cannot run in this
environment** — `api.groq.com` is denied at CONNECT — so the mechanism the
ablation exists to measure is absent.

What this harness therefore measures is **the cost of retrieval, not its
benefit**: the extra MCP round trip, the extra evidence items, the extra
milliseconds. The benefit side is structurally zero here, and that is a fact
about the environment rather than a finding about retrieval. §9A says a measured
null beats a fabricated win; this is weaker than a null — it is a *structurally
determined* zero, and the published results say so in those words rather than
implying an experiment that was not run.

The harness itself is real and complete. On a machine with a working key, the
same command produces the comparison §9A actually asks for.

TWO TIMINGS, BOTH REPORTED (LAW 5 — every number comes from a real clock):

  `time_to_root_cause_s`   the whole thing, detection included
  `post_detection_s`       from "failure observed" to "root cause available"

Both are published because either alone misleads. `dbt run` takes seconds and
dominates the total, which would bury any retrieval effect — the same reason §9A
rejects MTTR in favour of time-to-root-cause. But dropping detection entirely
would understate what an operator actually waits for.
