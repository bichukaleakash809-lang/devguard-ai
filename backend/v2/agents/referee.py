"""
referee.py — §6's Referee: validate the fix, then verify recovery. Deterministic.

§6: *"Referee | deterministic | test runner, verification queries | Validate the
fix; later, verify recovery."*

Two calls at two different moments, and the difference matters:

  * `validate(proposal)` runs **before** anyone approves anything, against a
    throwaway schema, from a copy of the project with the patch applied. The
    working tree is never touched, so a fix that does not work costs nothing and
    changes nothing.
  * `verify_recovery(failure)` runs **after** remediation and asks one question:
    *does the exact signal that failed now pass?* Not "do the tests pass", not
    "does it look right" — the specific command, the specific model, the
    specific column.

§8's hard rule is what makes the second one load-bearing: *"Nothing is written
before recovery is verified. Demonstrate this: a deliberately failing fix writes
nothing."* The Scribe takes a `RecoveryReport` and refuses to write unless
`verified` is True, so the guarantee lives in a type rather than in a comment.
