"""
watcher.py — §6's Watcher. Deterministic, no model, RuntimeEvidenceProvider only.

§6 classifies Watcher as `deterministic` with the tool allowlist
`RuntimeEvidenceProvider only`. That is not a simplification for convenience: an
LLM cannot make an exit code more true, and putting one on the detection path
would mean the *one* piece of evidence §7 will not let us do without could be
hallucinated. Detection is the last place in this system that should be
probabilistic.

What this produces is `RUNTIME` + `TRUSTED_SYSTEM` + `OBSERVED` evidence — the
only source in §7 that can establish that something actually happened, as
opposed to that a catalog says something is a certain way.
