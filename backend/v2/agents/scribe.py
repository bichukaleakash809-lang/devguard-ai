"""
scribe.py — §6's Scribe: the only agent that writes to DataHub. §8's five artifacts.

§8's hard rules, and where each one lives in this file:

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| "Nothing is written before recovery is verified" | `write_back()` takes a `RecoveryReport` and returns immediately unless `verified` is True. Not a check that can be skipped — there is no other entry point. |
| Idempotency key `(incident_id, artifact_type, target_urn)` | `_key()`, checked against the catalog before each write; outcome recorded as `written / already_present / failed`. |
| "the incident is marked RESOLVED only after all knowledge artifacts have landed" | `_resolve_incident()` runs last and is skipped if any knowledge artifact failed. |
| "Stamp every artifact" | `STAMP`, carrying evidence ids, UTC, and the chain digest. |
| Dry run shows the exact payloads | `dry_run=True` records the full payload it *would* send, and sends nothing. |

The partial-failure rule is the subtle one and it is worth stating plainly: if
the runbook write fails but the tag succeeds, marking the incident RESOLVED
would leave the graph asserting a verified state whose supporting knowledge does
not exist. So the incident stays ACTIVE and the run reports partial. A catalog
that is wrong in the optimistic direction is worse than one that is incomplete.

D1/D3 discovered three live-server behaviours that constrain this agent, all in
`docs/v2/INTEGRATION_LOG.md`: there is no `Runbook` document type (finding 7 —
`Analysis` is §8's "nearest honest alternative"); a tag must exist before it can
be applied (finding 8); and a string property whose value parses as a URN breaks
`searchAcrossLineage` (finding 16 — hence `devguard.last_incident_id`, a bare
id).
