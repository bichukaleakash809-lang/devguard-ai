surgeon.py — §6's Surgeon: propose the minimal fix as a diff on a branch. Never apply.

§6's row: *"Surgeon | LLM + repo tools | git/branch/patch — **never apply** |
Propose the minimal fix as a diff on a branch."*

**This implementation is deterministic, and that is a deliberate departure from
§6's "LLM + tools" classification.** §6 itself licenses the choice — *"Several
are deterministic and use no model at all — say so in the README, because 'we
did not put an LLM where an LLM was not needed' is a senior-engineering signal"*
— but the reasoning has to survive scrutiny, so here it is in full.

For an upstream column rename, the fix is not a judgement call **when the
mapping is unambiguous**:

    the model references a column the database no longer has   -> `dead`
    the database has a column the model does not reference     -> `orphan`

If there is exactly one of each, the rename is `dead -> orphan` and no
creativity is involved. If there is more than one candidate, the mapping *is* a
judgement call — and this Surgeon **refuses** rather than guessing, in the same
spirit as the Diagnostician's `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`. A wrong column mapping
silently produces a model that builds successfully and computes the wrong
numbers, which is far worse than a build that stays red.

The honest caveat, stated because the alternative is overclaiming: this covers
one fix class. A Surgeon that handles arbitrary breakage needs a model, and
`api.groq.com` is blocked in this environment, so an LLM Surgeon could not have
been demonstrated either. What is here is real, runs, and refuses when it should
— it is not a general code-repair agent and this module does not pretend to be.

The minimal fix is `customer_id as user_id`, not a rename of the downstream
column. That keeps the contract `stg_users` publishes to `user_order_features`
and the ML model intact, so the blast radius of the *fix* is one file. A fix
that renamed the column everywhere would be larger, riskier, and would itself
break the mlModel's feature contract.
