"""
cartographer.py — §6's Cartographer: resolve the failure to real URNs, pull schema truth.

§6's responsibility line: *"Resolve the failing artifact to real DataHub URNs;
pull schema truth."* Allowlist: `search`, `get_entities`, `list_schema_fields`.

The reason this agent exists as its own bounded role is that the Watcher's
output is a *string from a log* — `stg_users`, `user_id` — and everything
downstream needs a *URN*. That translation is the seam where a system quietly
starts analysing the wrong asset, so it gets its own agent, its own evidence,
and its own failure mode: if the failing artifact cannot be resolved, the
Cartographer says so rather than guessing.

Two honest notes about "schema truth":

  * The schema this reads is the **catalog's** schema, which is exactly what
    makes it useful during drift: the catalog says `user_id`, the database says
    `customer_id`, and the gap between them IS the incident. This agent must not
    "helpfully" reconcile them.
  * Every description and field-description it reads is catalog free-text and
    goes through the Sentinel before it can reach a prompt (§11.2).
