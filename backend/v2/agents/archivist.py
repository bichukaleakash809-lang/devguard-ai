"""
archivist.py — §6's Archivist: capability negotiation, then prior knowledge.

Two responsibilities, and the first one is the interesting one.

**Capability negotiation** (§4 step 4). §5's trap: *"`search_documents` /
`grep_documents` are **automatically hidden when the catalog has no documents**
— i.e. on a clean instance and during incident #1. Code must negotiate
capabilities and degrade deliberately, never throw."*

So the Archivist's job on incident #1 is to *not find anything*, and to say so
in a way that is distinguishable from an error. That distinction is the whole
point: "there is no prior runbook for this" and "the document search broke" lead
to completely different downstream behaviour, and a system that conflates them
will happily report a clean bill of health when its retrieval is down.

`AgentDecision.DEGRADED` carries that distinction, and D0 already confirmed the
trap is real: the live server offered 18 tools, and both document tools were
among the absent ones (integration finding 4).

**Prior knowledge.** Anything the documents *do* return is human-authored text
from a shared catalog, so it is `DATAHUB_DOCUMENT` + `UNTRUSTED_TEXT` by
construction — the Evidence model refuses to let it be anything else — and it
goes through the Sentinel before any agent reads it.
