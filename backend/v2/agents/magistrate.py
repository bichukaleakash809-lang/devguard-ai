"""
magistrate.py — §6's Magistrate: risk class, owners from the graph, approval routing.

§6: *"Magistrate | deterministic + LLM | `get_entities` (owners) read-only |
Risk classification, autonomy policy, owner-routed approval."*

§11.5 requires *"a written table: risk class → allowed action → who approves.
HIGH/CRITICAL always requires the named owner."* `AUTONOMY_POLICY` below **is**
that table — the same object the docs render and the code branches on, so the
published policy and the enforced policy cannot drift apart.

Two decisions are deliberate:

**Owners come from the graph, not from config.** §4 step 14 says "owners from
the graph → approval routed by real name". If the asset has no owner, that is
itself a finding: an unowned production table with a live incident is a
governance gap, and §8 artifact 5 exists to close it. The Magistrate reports
`UNOWNED` rather than silently routing to a default approver.

**Approval is recorded, never inferred.** `Approval` carries an identity, a
timestamp and a decision, and `ApprovalRequest.approve()` requires all three.
There is no auto-approve path for HIGH or CRITICAL, and `CRITICAL` has no
approver at all — §11.5's table has no row that permits it, so neither does the
code.
