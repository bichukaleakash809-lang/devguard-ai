handoff.py — the §6 AgentHandoff envelope, and the tool allowlist that makes
"least privilege" a property of the code rather than a claim in a README.

§6: "Every agent's allowlist is enforced in code and asserted in tests, so
'least privilege' is verifiable, not claimed." That sentence is the reason
`ToolAllowlist` lives here instead of in a config file nobody reads: the check
runs on the call path, so an agent that reaches for a tool it was not granted
raises before any network I/O happens.

The security properties §6 says should fall out of this design, and where they
actually do:

  * Diagnostician has no tools     -> AGENT_TOOL_ALLOWLISTS["diagnostician"] is
                                      empty, and ToolAllowlist.check refuses
                                      everything.
  * Only Scribe can mutate         -> the mutation tools appear in exactly one
                                      allowlist, asserted in tests.
  * rationale is display-only      -> typed as such, and never fed back into a
                                      prompt by any agent in this package.
