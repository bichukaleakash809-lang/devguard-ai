==========================
Circuit breaker + graceful degradation for the LLM-calling functions.

SRE DESIGN NOTES — BLAST RADIUS CONTAINMENT
-------------------------------------------
The Groq API is a hard external dependency. When an upstream LLM provider has a
bad hour (rate limits, 5xx storms, latency cliffs), the naive failure mode is:
every /scan request hangs for its full timeout, worker threads pile up, the
event loop saturates, and a *provider* incident becomes an *us* incident. That
is the exact blast-radius amplification a circuit breaker exists to prevent.

STATE MACHINE (classic 3-state breaker):
  CLOSED     -> normal. Count consecutive failures.
  OPEN       -> after N consecutive failures, stop calling primary. Fail fast /
                route to fallback. Stay open for `reset_timeout` (cooldown).
  HALF_OPEN  -> after cooldown, allow ONE trial call. Success -> CLOSED.
                Failure -> back to OPEN (restart cooldown).

TUNING RATIONALE (documented for postmortem review):
  fail_max = 5        -> Five *consecutive* failures. Low enough to trip within
                         a couple seconds of a real outage; high enough that a
                         single transient blip doesn't flap the breaker.
  reset_timeout = 30s -> Cooldown. LLM provider incidents rarely resolve in <30s;
                         probing more aggressively just adds load to an already
                         struggling upstream (and burns our rate limit). 30s is
                         the sweet spot between "recover fast" and "don't DDoS
                         the recovery."
  FALLBACK strategy   -> While OPEN we don't just fail — we degrade to a smaller,
                         cheaper, usually-more-available model (llama-3.1-8b-instant).
                         A degraded-but-live answer beats a 503 for a code scan.

Every state transition is emitted as a span event AND a counter metric, so in
SigNoz you can overlay "breaker opened" markers on the latency graph and
instantly correlate a latency spike with the upstream that caused it.

SELF-OBSERVATION LAYER (added):
  On every CLOSED -> OPEN (or HALF_OPEN -> OPEN) transition, the breaker now
  fires off an async, best-effort request to `PostmortemAgent` asking it to
  narrate "what just happened" in plain language, and attaches that narration
  to the same span as a `circuit_breaker.postmortem` event. This turns a raw
  "breaker opened" telemetry blip into something a human (or another agent)
  can read without correlating logs by hand. This generation is intentionally
  OFF the synchronous state-machine path — see the `# SELF-OBSERVATION:`
  comments below for exactly where and why.
